# Project Overview

This project contains a set of SQL solutions completed in Google BigQuery using a retail sales dataset. The goal of the exercise is to practise real-world SQL tasks such as filtering data, creating calculated fields, applying conditional logic, performing aggregations, and analysing customer and product behaviour.
All questions and tasks are based on the practical exercise document provided. 

# Objectives

Develop proficiency in writing SQL queries in Google BigQuery

Clean and prepare data for analysis

Apply functions such as EXTRACT, DATE, GROUP BY, HAVING, CASE, and CAST

Calculate key metrics such as total revenue and quantity sold

Classify customers and transactions using conditional logic

Solve practical data analysis questions in a structured manner

# Methodology (Summary)

Loaded the retail dataset into Google BigQuery

Inspected data types and cleaned inconsistent or text-based fields

Applied filtering using WHERE and date functions

Performed aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG) to calculate metrics

Classified data using CASE statements

Grouped and summarised data for product categories, customer ages, spending, and transaction behaviour

Returned final outputs according to each question’s requirements
